# Titanic Survival Prediction with Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Random Forests. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), and model evaluation.

## Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world data
- Built multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Performed Grid Search with cross-validation
- Interpreted feature importances and visualized results

## Tools Used
- Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Try It
Clone the repo and run the notebook:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/titanic_model.ipynb
